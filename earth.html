  <h1>Earth and Space Science</h1>
  <h5> The International Space Station is a “global observation and diagnosis station.” It promotes international Earth observations aimed at understanding and resolving the environmental issues of our home planet. A wide variety of Earth observation payloads can be attached to the exposed facilities on the station’s exterior as well as in the Window Observational Research Facility located within the Destiny module.  The presence of a human crew also provides a unique capability for real-time observation of the Earth, and “on the fly” data collection using hand-held digital cameras, and the astronauts may also provide input to ground personnel programming the station’s automated Earth observation systems. Several instruments are currently collecting data from the International Space Station; in addition,  some instruments have completed their data collection missions, with other remote sensing systems in development or proposed by researchers from the partner countries, NASA, academic institutions, and corporations. The existing international partnerships, fundamental to the International Space Station, facilitate data sharing that can benefit people around the world and promote international collaboration on other Earth observation activities. The station contributes to humanity by collecting data on the global climate, environmental change, and natural hazards using its unique complement of crew-operated and automated Earth observation payloads.
