######About
In this project I am showing how many different research projects have been executed on the ISS.
 
 
######first idea
At first I had the idea to make kind of an Interactive-Browser-App.  
I wanted to integrate some different by the NASA provided information. The idea was to give the feeling of nearness and real communication. I decided to give a menu for choosing to get information about the astronauts, live broadcast from the ISS and the newest tweet. Moreover I wanted to show the current research topics, their universities and the current position of the ISS...

definetely too much...

######second plan
I just played a little with the data.  

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logetcrea/research-matters/master/screens/iss.png" width="100%" style="display: inline-block;" />
  
I decided to take only the research data and visualize the differences in topic, time and their different investigators.

But I had a lot trouble getting the data...  
g.e. with [import.io](https://import.io/)  
 
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logetcrea/research-matters/master/screens/io-fail.png" width="100%" style="display: inline-block;" />

So I changed the strategy and tried [HTTrack](http://www.httrack.com/html/abuse.html), a gorgeous tool for copying websites. To get the desired data, I had to filter the html with another genius tool, called [pup](https://github.com/EricChiang/pup). I precticed [Regex](http://regexr.com/) in my Text-Editor for deleting some in my case useless rubish, but all that did not work well, because of unfortunately, improbable circumstances. Pup is a nice tool, but you need tags in your html. Unfortunately exactly my desired information wasn't in a tag...
