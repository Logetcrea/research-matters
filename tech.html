  <h5 id="more"> In space, physical processes can be better understood with the control of external influences such as gravity. Technical innovations designed for space systems are tested on the International Space Station (ISS) before use in other spacecraft systems. While investigating how new technologies operate in space, unexpected discoveries are possible. Simplified physical systems can also be directly used to improve models of physical processes leading to new industrial techniques and materials.

    The ISS provides the unique capability to perform long-duration experiments in the absence of gravity and in interaction with other spacecraft systems not available in any other laboratory. Additional insight comes from the presence of the ISS crew observing and interacting with these experiments and participating in the discovery process.

    The ISS research portfolio includes many engineering and technology investigations designed to take advantage of these opportunities. Experiments investigating thermal processes, nanostructures, fluids and other physical characteristics are taking place to develop these technologies and provide new innovations in those fields. Additionally, advanced engineering activities operating in the space station infrastructure are proving next-generation space systems to increase capabilities and decrease risks to future missions. Emerging materials, technology and engineering research activities on the ISS are developing into benefits for economic development and quality of life.
